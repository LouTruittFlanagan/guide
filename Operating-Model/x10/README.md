x10 Philosophy
==============

 

x10 Thinking is a philosophy put in place by GE, and later Google, to drive
their thinking processes.  The core idea is this:  don’t move in little chunks.
When evaluating a situations, understand your current view of the situation
(CVS), and then create a better view of the situation (BVS) that is 10 times
(x10) better than the current situation.  Then, work backward to go from the CVS
to the BVS.  That is how you plan.

 

Key ideas and concepts:

-   CVS. Current view of the Situation. Everyone has one. It’s a point of view.

-   BVS. Better View of the Situation (BVS).  You can either keep your CVS, or
    change it. That’s the only 2 options available to you.

-   A key idea in x10 is the “CHECK”.  Similar to chess, in 1 move, can you end
    the game (accomplish what you want to accomplish)?  If so, then you are in
    CHECK.  If not, you are in UNCHECK.  What has to happen for the organization
    to get into CHECK on this situation?

-   Innovation. Innovation is really nothing more than trying to achieve a
    positive change in your situation. The fundamental process of innovation is
    CHANGE. To make a change, you have to have an ALTERNATIVE. Options mean
    hope. Change is what happens between before and after.

-   Absolute truths versus fuzzy logic.  People see the world differently.
    Because of this, each has a different view of what “truth” is. So, instead
    of arguing about differences, attempt to get to the agreed upon CVS.

-   Aristotelean thinking versus x10 thinking. For 2,500+ years, we have been
    taught to take a viewpoint, and argue the “rightness” of that viewpoint.
    Meetings are often a collection of people in a room, arguing their
    viewpoints. But, the point of that arguing doesn’t get to a BVS. It simply
    moves the business incrementally.

-   Replication is a “win.” Similar to reproduction, the good ideas, the good
    products, the good anything is the one that wins—that replicates itself.
    Creating a “winning” thing requires an evolution of the concept. So, every
    process, every idea, should be built with some measure of its success, and a
    duration (lifetime). On termination of the lifetime, the item is replicated
    and modified and tried again, or is considered terminated based on its
    metrics.

 

Key questions to ask when forming a BVS

-   What are we really trying to escape?  Develop a main point.

-   Ask why? Why is this so complicated? Why do people hate this? Why is it
    organized this way? Ask is this may reaction? Why does it make this noise?

-   Ask why not? Why not reverse the sequence? Why not ask someone their
    opinion? Why not expand it? Why not shrink it? Why not borrow an idea?  Why
    not increase it?

-   Opportunity: Ask what is the opportunity here?  What is the gain potential
    in the situation?

-   Who. Who can help us? Who can I ask for advice about this?

-   Known path. Are there steps or a stairway I can take to get there?

-   Replication. What is the pattern? What is this most similar to that we can
    pattern off of?

-   Trigger/Notice. What do I need to pay attention to?

-   Metric. How will we know we’ve gotten there?

-   Lifespan. How long will it take for us to get there?

-   Start: How do we get started? (write the numbers 1 to 10 on a piece of
    paper, fill in the list).

-   Do. What do I do RIGHT now to start the momentum rolling?
